# Mandelbrot
This is a simple demonstration of the Mandelbrot set, and the corresponding Julia sets. The UI is currently unfinished, but everything else works fine. 
There is a slider for chosing the exponent of the multibrot set. 

Under development: 
1. Make the Julia-set corresponding to the current multibrot set. (Easy fix)
2. Speed up. Currently the program only renders the Julia-set every second to save CPU-time. 
3. Make the user interface more user friendly.
